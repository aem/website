    'Hi! I grew up in Minnesota and have since moved to Boston for school. I now study Computer Science and Business Administration at Northeastern University. Check out some of the other tiles to learn a little more about me!',
  developer:
    "I've got roughly 8 years of development experience (I taught myself C at the age of 13!) and my experience has led me to be a web developer with full-stack skills, but specializing in front-end development. I've published several open-source libraries and all of my development work is showcased on this website and my GitHub account.",
  video:
    "Every single Northeastern University Division I home game is televised, made possible by the amazing team at GoNUxstream. I work primarily as a Producer, Director, Technical Director, and, as needed, instant replay operator and graphics producer. We've produced regional broadcasts for Comcast SportsNet, NESN, and nationwide broadcasts on NHLNetowkr and ASN.",
  biking:
    "About two years ago I took up biking, initially as a way to commute to work, and eventually I continued to bike in my free time. Since then I've biked thousands of miles across the city of Boston and its outlying suburbs."
